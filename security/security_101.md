# Security 101

### Use strong passwords

What is a strong password?
- Good password **lenght** (at least **16** characters)
- **Random** characters (Uppercase, lowercase) numbers and symbols (:(){ :|:& };:)
- **Not** a **dictionary word**
- Not like your **previous** passwords
- Not a keyboard pattern, such as **zxcvbn**, **qweqwe123** or **1q2w3e**

### Use password managers

I personaly recomend [bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com)

Pros:
- Free for personal use
- Cross-platform (Desktop, Mobile, Browser extensions, CLI, Web)
- [Standalone](https://bitwarden.com/help/install-and-deploy-offline/) installation

Cons:
- 2fa is a premium feature

> Use strong master password and keep it in secure place!

### Use 2fa

First of all you need a 2fa app. I personaly recommend [2FAS](https://2fas.com/)

Pros:
- Free for personal use
- Cross-platform (Android, IOS)
- Backup (Cloud and file)
- App security (PIN, face ID)
- Browser extentions

Cons:
- Icloud sync enabled by default

What else you should know about 2fa:
- Don't use SMS for OTP bacause of **SIM swapping**
- Don't use Face ID because you can't store your face in a safe place
- Better to use hardware 2fa device. See [YubiKey](https://www.yubico.com/)
- Always **download** your **recovery codes** and keep it in a **safe** place

### Email services

Use secure mail service [Proton mail](https://proton.me)

Pros:
- Trackers blocking (eg. Sendgrid.com)
- One free VPN connection
- One GB free for mail, calendar and drive
- Password manager
Cons:
- Limited storage

Use email masking service [Firefox Relay](https://relay.firefox.com)

### Browsers

[Opera]() is fastest way to get a **free VPN** for browsing sites on your devices. **No registration** needed!

[DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/&) it's a search engine focused on privacy and awesome browser with **fire mode**, [bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com), automatic **cookies** management.
